### Usage Notes
  
* When you first launch the application, you will be redirected via your default browser to link a Google account. Make sure you use your OneTick email for authentication, or the program will not be able to download required files from the drive. If you are using an appropriate account and still have issues, ensure you have been given permissions to view all required files. If the authentication is successful, you you only need to do this once.
* Before actually generating any contracts, you should create an output folder where you want them generated to. When you launch the application, use the "Output Directory" widget to select the appropriate folder. Unless you choose to use a different folder in the future, you will only need to do this once.
